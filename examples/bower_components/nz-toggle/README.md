__Double and Triple-State Toggle for Angular__

## Features
- Native checkboxes are ugly, inconsistent, and involve insane CSS tweaks to style. nz-toggle is a simple directive that relieves all of the pain of styling `<input type="checkbox">`
- Indeterminate checkboxes are great for nested checklists, but emit a `false` value in that state. nz-toggle's `tri-toggle` mode fixes this by truthfully providing 3 separate value states.
- Tooltips for the tri-toggle impaired.

## Get Started

Install via NPM or Bower

`npm install --save nz-toggle`
`bower install --save nz-toggle`

Include Files

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=".../nz-toggle/dist/nz-toggle.min.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src=".../nz-toggle/dist/nz-toggle.min.js"></script>
```

Add nzToggle in your angular app to your module as a requirement.

```
var app = angular.module('app', ['nzToggle']);
```

## Using the directive

```html
<nz-toggle
  tri-toggle
  on-toggle="myFunction()"
  ng-model="value">
</nz-toggle>

<!-- Default Values : false-val = 0, null-val = null, true-val = true; -->
```

```html
<nz-toggle
  tri-toggle
  on-toggle="myFunction()"
  ng-model="value"
  val-true="'myString'"
  val-false="0"
  val-null="-1">
</nz-toggle>

```
