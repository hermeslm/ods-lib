## Getting Started

Documentation will be coming soon.

### Install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the git ods-lib repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-component-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

## Updating Angular

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can install and update the Angular dependencies by running:

install dependencies:
```
bower install
```
update dependencies:
```
bower update
```

## Build the library and samples

If you want to build a distribution of this library just run a gulp task, this is the default task.
```
gulp build
``` 
You can check the `gulpfile.js` and check all defined gulp task.
